Fish feeder with scheduling according to weight of the feed and monitored using Blynk App.
You can set the schedule and the weight each feeding time on the Blynk App.

Because this is a project for undergraduate, so i didn't make the schematic. So you may look for pins used at the arduino file programs (.ino files).
You can see the diagram below for raw connection :
